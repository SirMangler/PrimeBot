answer = "Savestates can be incredibly buggy. They should not be used between versions and become even more broken if you have changed settings since last the last savestate.

They shouldn't be relied on as they can easily be corrupted and make you lose your progress. Please be careful to confirm any bugs you're having are not caused by savestates."

[dolphin]
answer = "PrimeHack is built on Dolphin Emulator. The PrimeHack discord server is primarily for support and information directly related to *PrimeHack*. 

Because of this, we cannot always provide support for regular Dolphin and issues that do not relate directly to PrimeHack, with the exception of tips for running Metroid: Prime Trilogy.

We recommend for general **Dolphin Emulator** support, you go to the Dolphin Emulator discord server.

[ishiiruka]
answer = "Ishiiruka is a fork of Dolphin Emulator which adds a few more graphical options such as material maps, advanced shaders and various other tweaks. Ishiiruka runs on a much older build of Dolphin Emulator so it will not have some of the more up to date features. 

Some users find they get better performance on Ishiiruka however overall it appears the majority of users get better performance on the later/regular builds of Dolphin.

PrimeHack is also offered on Ishiiruka:

[uac]
answer = "
**-** **U**ser **A**ccount **C**ontrol **-**

UAC _(aka admin access or elevated privileges)_ is a system that requires user consent to execute certain applications and write files to a UAC protected location. 
 
Some applications do not request elevated privileges automatically. If this happens, they may behave inappropriately. An example of this is if Dolphin is ran in portable mode within `C:\Program Files\`.
